# Task: Wire Add-Host Into Config-Persistence Triad And Close LAN/Host-Ports Gap

## Purpose and scope

Two related, same-surface changes to ai-sandbox's config-persistence machinery:

**(A) Full triad participation for `--add-host`.** Wire the `CLI_ADD_HOST` array
(task 001) through the complete config-persistence triad exactly as
`--allow-egress` is wired, so an `--add-host` value survives `start`/restore and
routes through the `running_config_matches()` consent gate (no silent recreate
of a running container without a prompt). See the
[config-persistence decision](../notes/config-persistence-decision.md).

**(B) Close the pre-existing `yS0R` gap.** `AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR` and
`AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS` are recomputed from live host state every
invocation and passed to the container via `environment:` only — they get no
`ai.sandbox.*` label and are absent from `running_config_matches()`'s comparison
set. That means host-state drift (a WiFi switch, a background process opening a
port) can silently recreate a running `lan-access`/`host-access` container with
no consent prompt, violating the project's "no silent recreate without consent"
principle. Route both values through the consent gate (label + comparison). This
is followup `yS0R`; the user directed it be folded into this plan.

Both changes touch the same files (`docker/docker-compose.yaml` labels/env,
`src/utils.sh` `running_config_matches()`), so they are one task to avoid two
agents editing `running_config_matches()`'s format string concurrently.

## Requirements

### Part A — `--add-host` triad wiring

Mirror the `--allow-egress` precedent at every site. The persisted value is the
CLI array itself (`--add-host` has no profile-level equivalent to merge, exactly
like `--allow-egress`).

1. **`src/index.sh` — derive the JSON and env forms.** Add an
   `_cli_add_host_json` computed once alongside `_cli_allow_egress_json`
   (lines ~199-203): `[]` when `CLI_ADD_HOST` is empty, else the array as a JSON
   array. Add an `AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST` env var derived from it by `'|'`-join
   (mirror `AI_SANDBOX_ALLOW_EGRESS` at lines ~381-382) and add it to the
   `export` list at lines ~383-384.
2. **`src/index.sh` — config-input record.** Add an `add_host` field to the
   `AI_SANDBOX_CONFIG_JSON` `jq -n` record (lines ~256-271), passing
   `--argjson add_host "${_cli_add_host_json}"`. This makes it the tenth
   config-input dimension. Keep `version: 1` — it is an additive optional field,
   same reasoning already applied for `allow_egress` (8th) and
   `static_playground` (9th); update the surrounding comments (lines ~215-238,
   ~251-255) to say "ten config-input dimensions" and name `add_host` as the
   tenth.
3. **`docker/docker-compose.yaml` — env + label.** Add
   `AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST=${AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST:-}` to **both** the `ai-sandbox`
   service `environment:` block (near line ~132) and the firewall-init sidecar
   `environment:` block (near line ~207) — keep the two blocks in sync as the
   existing comments instruct. Add an `ai.sandbox.add-host:
   "${AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST:-}"` label to the `labels:` block (near line ~76,
   beside `ai.sandbox.allow-egress`), with a comment mirroring the
   allow-egress label comment.
   - **Note:** whether the sidecar actually needs `AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST` depends
     on task 004 (host-access-visibility) — the sidecar runs
     `docker/init-firewall.sh`. Adding it to both blocks is the safe, precedent-
     matching default (allow-egress is in both); keep them in sync.
4. **`src/utils.sh` — `restore_saved_config()`.** Add `saved_add_host` decoding
   (mirror `saved_allow_egress`, line ~530), then a validation-and-rehydrate
   block (mirror lines ~613-632) that re-validates each restored spec with
   `is_valid_add_host_spec()` (task 001), warns-and-drops invalid entries, and
   sets `CLI_ADD_HOST` from the validated set. Add `CLI_ADD_HOST` to the
   function's `# shellcheck disable=SC2034` globals comment and the
   local-declarations line (~490), mirroring `CLI_ALLOW_EGRESS`.
5. **`src/utils.sh` — `running_config_matches()`.** Add
   `ai.sandbox.add-host` to the multi-field `docker inspect` format string
   (`fmt`, line ~681), add a `cur_add_host` field to the `IFS` read
   (lines ~683-685) and its local declaration (line ~666), and add the
   comparison `[ "${cur_add_host:-}" = "${AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST:-}" ] || return 1`
   in the comparison block (lines ~687-697). Update the header comment
   (lines ~645-662) to include `AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST`.

### Part B — close the `yS0R` gap (LAN_CIDR + HOST_LISTEN_PORTS)

These two are **host-detected**, recomputed every run (not CLI inputs), so they
do **not** go into the `ai.sandbox.config` JSON record and are **not** rehydrated
by `restore_saved_config()` — they are freshly recomputed each invocation
(`src/index.sh` lines ~396-400 for `AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR`, ~551-573 for
`AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS`). Their triad participation is label + comparison
only:

6. **`docker/docker-compose.yaml` — labels.** Add
   `ai.sandbox.lan-cidr: "${AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR:-}"` and
   `ai.sandbox.host-listen-ports: "${AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS:-}"` to the
   `labels:` block, each with a short comment noting they capture host-detected
   state at create/start time (the `environment:` entries already exist at
   lines ~141, ~159, ~215-216).
7. **`src/utils.sh` — `running_config_matches()`.** Add both labels to `fmt`,
   read into `cur_lan_cidr` / `cur_host_ports` locals, and add
   `[ "${cur_lan_cidr:-}" = "${AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR:-}" ] || return 1` and
   `[ "${cur_host_ports:-}" = "${AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS:-}" ] || return 1`.
   **Consequence (intended):** when host state drifts between two `start`
   invocations (new listening port, changed LAN), `running_config_matches()` now
   returns 1, so the caller's existing consent prompt fires before recreating —
   exactly reading (a) of followup `yS0R`, upholding "no silent recreate without
   consent." Document this intended behavior in a code comment so it is not later
   mistaken for a bug. (These values are empty when the corresponding capability
   is inactive, so the comparison is a no-op `"" = ""` for containers without
   `lan-access`/`host-access`.)

### Part C — followup `WjsY` comment fix (trivial, same surface)

8. **`src/status.sh` line ~48.** Update the stale comment that says "seven-field
   config record" to reflect the current field count (now ten with `add_host`).
   Word it as "config record" without a brittle hardcoded count if that reads
   more cleanly, or use the correct current count. This closes followup `WjsY`.

### Housekeeping

9. **Rebuild the rollup** (`make build`) after all `src/` edits.
10. Do **not** edit `plan/followups.yaml` — removing `yS0R`/`WjsY` is the
    manager's job via `apply-task-report` once this task lands.

## Validation

- `make lint` passes.
- `make build` regenerates `bin/ai-sandbox.sh`.
- **`--add-host` round-trip (manual or task-005 automated):** create a container
  with `--add-host myhost:10.0.0.5`; confirm the `ai.sandbox.add-host` label and
  `ai.sandbox.config` JSON (`.add_host`) carry the value; a subsequent
  per-instance command with no flags rehydrates `CLI_ADD_HOST` from the label
  (via `restore_saved_config()`) and `running_config_matches()` returns 0
  (match) — no spurious recreate prompt.
- **Drift detection:** with the same container running, invoking `start` while
  passing a *different* `--add-host` value makes `running_config_matches()`
  return 1 (mismatch → consent prompt), like `--allow-egress`.
- **`yS0R`:** for a `host-access`/`lan-access` container, changing the host's
  listening ports (or simulating a different `AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS`/
  `AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR`) between the captured label and the recomputed value
  makes `running_config_matches()` return 1 (was previously an undetected silent
  recreate). Confirm the empty-value / capability-inactive case still returns 0.
- `docker compose ... config` renders valid YAML with the three new labels.

## Metadata

architectural_impact: true

(Adds significant tracked state — a new persisted config-input field plus three
new `ai.sandbox.*` labels — and changes the documented config-persistence
consent-gate behavior in `docs/architecture.md`.)

## Status

**Outcome:** succeeded (2026-07-18).

**Part A (`--add-host` triad wiring):** `_cli_add_host_json`/`AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST`
mirror `_cli_allow_egress_json`/`AI_SANDBOX_ALLOW_EGRESS` in `src/index.sh`;
`add_host` is now the tenth field in the `AI_SANDBOX_CONFIG_JSON` record
(`version` unchanged at 1, additive field). `docker/docker-compose.yaml` carries
`AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST` in both the `ai-sandbox` and `firewall-init` `environment:`
blocks and an `ai.sandbox.add-host` label. `restore_saved_config()`
(`src/utils.sh`) decodes `saved_add_host`, re-validates each restored spec
against `is_valid_add_host_spec()` (task 001), and rehydrates `CLI_ADD_HOST`,
dropping (with a warning) any entry that fails validation.
`running_config_matches()` adds `ai.sandbox.add-host` to the multi-field
`docker inspect` format string and compares `AI_SANDBOX_ADD_HOST` the same way
as `AI_SANDBOX_ALLOW_EGRESS`.

**Part B (`yS0R` gap closure):** `ai.sandbox.lan-cidr` and
`ai.sandbox.host-listen-ports` labels added to `docker/docker-compose.yaml`
(the `environment:` entries already existed). Neither is added to the
config-input JSON record or rehydrated by `restore_saved_config()` — both are
host-detected state recomputed every invocation, per the task's design.
`running_config_matches()` compares both labels against the freshly
recomputed `AI_SANDBOX_LAN_CIDR`/`AI_SANDBOX_HOST_LISTEN_PORTS`; a code
comment on the function documents that a mismatch-triggered recreate here is
the intended behavior (closing `yS0R`), not a bug.

**Part C (`WjsY`):** `src/status.sh`'s stale "seven-field config record"
comment reworded to "config record" (no hardcoded count) to avoid the
comment going stale again as more fields are added.

**Validation:** `make lint` and `make build` both pass. `docker compose
... config` (rendered with representative env values) shows all three new
labels (`ai.sandbox.add-host`, `ai.sandbox.lan-cidr`,
`ai.sandbox.host-listen-ports`) on both services. The full `--add-host`
round-trip, drift-detection (`--add-host` mismatch), and `yS0R` drift
scenarios (LAN CIDR mismatch, host-listen-ports mismatch, and the
empty/capability-inactive no-op case) from this task's `## Validation`
section were exercised directly against `restore_saved_config()`/
`running_config_matches()` with mocked `docker inspect` output (ad hoc
scripts in the scratchpad, not committed) and all produced the specified
exit codes. `shellspec test/unit/ai_sandbox_spec.sh` shows the same 272
examples / 7 failures as the pre-existing baseline (verified via `git
stash`) — the 7 failures are unrelated `dispatchtest` end-to-end dispatch
cases that fail identically with and without this task's changes; none of
the `running_config_matches()`/`restore_saved_config()`-specific examples
regressed.

**Note:** did not add new shellspec coverage for `--add-host`/`yS0R` in
`test/unit/ai_sandbox_spec.sh` — task 005 (`add-host-tests`) owns automated
test coverage for this flag per the plan's task breakdown; this task's
`## Validation` explicitly labels the round-trip/drift checks
"manual or task-005 automated".
